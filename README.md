# -Arduino-Solar-Lighting-Automation ðŸŒžðŸ’¡
This project leverages Arduino technology, solar panels, and LED lights to create a sustainable and efficient street lighting solution. By harnessing solar energy during the day, the system powers streetlights at night, ensuring eco-friendly and cost-effective outdoor illumination.

System Design Working Modes:
OFF mode: During the day, when natural light is abundant, the system remains off while the batteries recharge.

Active mode: As natural light diminishes to a certain threshold, the system activates and powers up the motion sensors.

ON mode: When pedestrians or traffic are detected, the sensors trigger the LED lights to illuminate. These lights dim if no further motion is sensed.

Components Used:
Arduino Board, LDR Sensor, IR Sensor, Rechargeable Battery & Solar Panels.

Key Features:
ðŸŒž Solar Energy Harvesting: Captures and stores solar energy during daylight hours to power LED streetlights after sunset.

ðŸ”§ Arduino Integration: Utilizes Arduino for smart control and efficient management of the lighting system.

ðŸ’¡ Energy Efficiency: Reduces energy consumption by relying on renewable solar power, contributing to sustainability.

ðŸ’¸ Cost Effectiveness: Minimizes operational costs with a self-sustaining power source, eliminating the need for external electricity.
