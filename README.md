# Arduino-Solar-Lighting-Automation ðŸŒžðŸ’¡
This project is an innovative and energy-efficient street lighting system powered by solar energy using Arduino, LEDs, LDR (Light Dependent Resistor), IR and flame sensors. The system optimizes energy consumption by maintaining low brightness at night and dynamically increasing the LED brightness upon detecting vehicles or motion via IR sensors. The flame sensor adds a safety feature by alerting in case of fire near the lights. Designed to operate autonomously, this project promotes sustainability and smart energy usage for modern street lightingÂ solutions.

System Design Working Modes:
OFF mode: During the day, when natural light is abundant, the system remains off while the batteries recharge.

Active mode: As natural light diminishes to a certain threshold, the system activates and powers up the motion sensors.

ON mode: When pedestrians or traffic are detected, the sensors trigger the LED lights to illuminate. These lights dim if no further motion is sensed.

# Components Used:
Arduino Board, LDR Sensor, IR Sensor, Rechargeable Battery & Solar Panels.

# Key Features:
ðŸŒž Solar Energy Harvesting: Captures and stores solar energy during daylight hours to power LED streetlights after sunset.

ðŸ”§ Arduino Integration: Utilizes Arduino for smart control and efficient management of the lighting system.

ðŸ’¡ Energy Efficiency: Reduces energy consumption by relying on renewable solar power, contributing to sustainability.

ðŸ’¸ Cost Effectiveness: Minimizes operational costs with a self-sustaining power source, eliminating the need for external electricity.
